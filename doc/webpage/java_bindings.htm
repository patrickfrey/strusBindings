	<p class="description">This chapter describes the language bindings of strus for Java based 
		on JNI and build with SWIG with examples of how to create and use them.<br/>
		The language bindings have been built using <a href="http://www.swig.org">SWIG</a>
		based on a wrapper C++ interface. This wrapper interface serves as common base
		for all language bindings as a sort of super interface (strus/bindingObjects.hpp).
		</p>
		<h2>Doxygen interface documentation</h2>
		<p class="description">There exist a <a href="http://patrickfrey.github.io/strusBindings/doc/java/doxygen/html/index.html">
		documentation for the Java interface</a> generated with
		doxygen. The interface has been derived from the wrapper interface used as base.
		It introduces all Java classes defined. Unfortunately it contains still some type 
		qualifiers pointing to it's C++ origin. Please don't blame it for that. I'll find solutions.
		Suggestions are welcome.
		</p>
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p class="description">All objects of the strus Java
		API are in the namespace "net.strus.api". The first thing you do, when using 
		the strus Java interface, is to create the root object called StrusContext. 
		From this context object you can construct the main instances
		of the objects doing the job you want to do. Depending on how you create
		the strus context, the objects you create beginning with the root object
		are accessed directly or they are residing on a server and the language 
		objects serve as proxy for the server objects.

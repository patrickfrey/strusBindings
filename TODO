Return values as array, serialization without required OPEN CLOSE to mark one value (NO Serialization is better)
papguga_SerializationIterator data structure and macros for iterating through a serialization, for keeping a door open for optimizations behind the scenes
Check multiple propagation of flags like -O0 -O2 -O3 for the same target (remove silly STRUS_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL)
Serialization node allocation chunkwise as in allocator without realloc (possible if papguga_SerializationIterator is available)
Serialization node allocation aligned
Save tag as private element in ValueVariant and used macros for access
Check if all submodules are consistent (e.g. latest nfixes of textwolf)

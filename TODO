Fix CodeProject Articles
Delete unused Docker images
Publish Docker images on webpage and refurbish installation page
Return values as array, serialization without required OPEN CLOSE to mark one value (NO Serialization is better)
papguga_SerializationIterator data structure and macros for iterating through a serialization, for keeping a door open for optimizations behind the scenes
Serialization node allocation chunkwise as in allocator without realloc (possible if papguga_SerializationIterator is available)
Serialization node allocation aligned

Check multiple propagation of flags like -O0 -O2 -O3 for the same target (remove silly STRUS_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL)

In XML/JSON call interface call papuga in steps, returning a breakpoint id each step
